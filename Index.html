	<h2 id="headline">Here's a time line of B.J. Habibie's life:</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>1936</strong> - Born in Parepare, South Sulawesi, Indonesia</li>
		<li><strong>1960</strong> - Received an engineer's degree in Germany with the title Diplom-Ingenieur. He remained in Germany as a research assistant under Hans Ebner at the Lehrstuhl und Institut für Leichtbau, RWTH Aachen to conduct research for his doctoral degree.</li>
		<li><strong>1962</strong> - Habibie returned to Indonesia for three months on sick leave. Then he is marrying his friend Hasri Ainun on May 12, 1962. Habibie and his wife settled in Aachen for a short period before moving to Oberforstbach. In May 1963 they had a son, Ilham Akbar Habibie</li>
		<li><strong>1965</strong> - Habibie delivered his dissertation in aerospace engineering and received the grade of "very good", giving him the title Doktoringenieur (Dr.-Ing.). The same year, he accepted Hans Ebner's offer to continue his research on Thermoelastisitas and work toward his habilitation, but he declined the offer to join RWTH as a professor. His thesis about light construction for supersonic or hypersonic states also attracted offers of employment from companies such as Boeing and Airbus, which Habibie again declined</li>
		<li><strong>1974</strong> - Habibie did accept a position with Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm in Hamburg. There, he developed theories on thermodynamics, construction, and aerodynamics known as the Habibie Factor (thermodynamics), Habibie Theorem (construction), and Habibie Method (aerodynamics), respectively. He worked for Messerschmitt on the development of the Airbus A-300B aircraft. He was promoted to vice president of the company. Also in 1974, Suharto recruited Habibie to return to Indonesia as part of his drive to industrialize and develop the country. Habibie initially served as a special assistant to Ibnu Sutowo, chief executive officer of the state oil company Pertamina and Chair of Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (Indonesian: Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi, BPPT)</li>
		<li><strong>1976</strong> - Habibie was made CEO of the new state-owned enterprise Industri Pesawat Terbang Nurtanio (IPTN; Nurtanio Aircraft Industry),[26] which in 1985 changed its name to Industri Pesawat Terbang Nusantara (Nusantara Aircraft Industry; also abbreviated as IPTN) and is known as Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia) since 2000.</li>
		<li><strong>1978</strong> - He was appointed as State Minister of Research and Technology (Indonesian: Menteri Negara Riset dan Teknologi, Menristek)</li>
		<li><strong>1998</strong> - Habibie was elected as vice president in March 1998. On 21 May 1998, just two months into Habibie's vice presidency, Suharto announced his resignation. Habibie, as the Constitution says, succeeded him as president.</li>
		<li><strong>1999</strong> - Habibie directed that an ID card was sufficient proof of Indonesian citizenship, revoking the previous requirement for a 'Letter of Evidence of Republic of Indonesia Citizenship' (SBKRI). Additionally, he lifted restrictions on the teaching of Mandarin Chinese.</li>
		<li><strong>2006</strong> - he released a book called Detik-Detik Yang Menentukan: Jalan Panjang Indonesia Menuju Demokrasi (Decisive Moments: Indonesia's Long Road Towards Democracy). </li>
		<li><strong>2019</strong> - In early September 2019, he was admitted to Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital, where he was undergoing treatments for heart problems,[58][59] namely cardiomyopathy,[60] and died on 11 September 2019.[61][62][63][64][65] He became the first president of Indonesia to be buried at the Kalibata Heroes' Cemetery, next to his wife's grave.</li>
